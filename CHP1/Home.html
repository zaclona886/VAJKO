                        <p>A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one
                        of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth
                        Hokage, Minato Namikaze (with his wife Kushina Uzumaki) seals the fox inside the body of his newborn
                        son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast; this costs Naruto's father his life, and the
                        Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by
                        Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding
                        any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when
                        Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the
                        respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.

                <p>Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes,
                and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja
                Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the
                villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.
                </p>
                <p>After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a
                ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as
                Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage
                for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches
                with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.

                        <p>During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic
                        heritage, the Sharingan. After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi, who
                        had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength
                        needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of
                        ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back.
                        Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke: Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to
                        prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.
